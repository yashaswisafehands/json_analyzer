**If** **no signs of severe preeclampsia **(see definitions):

Send home.

Schedule follow up appointment in 3-4 **days**, instruct in danger signs.

Plan delivery at referral facility, induction of labor at gestational age 38-39 **if** this procedure is performed **and** **if** gestational age is known.

# Chapter: BP 150-160/100/110

### BP 150-160/100/110

Admit **and** observe.

Assess BP each 8 **hours**.

**If** high blood pressure persists start oral antihypertensives for example:

Labetatol starting dose: 100 **mg** orally every 8 **hours** (can be repeated hourly)

**OR**

Methyldopa starting dose: 250 **mg** orally every 8 **hours**. See drug list for more details.

---

**If** blood pressure is reduced to between 140-150 systolic **and** 90-100 diastolic **AND** **if** there are **no signs of severe preeclampsia **(see definitions), the patient can be sent home.

Schedule follow up appointment in 3-4 **days**, instruct in danger signs.

Plan for delivery at referral facility, induction of labor at gestational age 38-39 **if** this procedure is performed **and** **if** gestational age is known.

# Chapter: SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA

### SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA

See definitions

Admit **and** treat.

> **THE SINGLE MOST** **IMPORTANT AIM IS TO** **KEEP SYSTOLIC BP** **BELOW 160 mmHg!**

Insert indwelling urine catheter.

Monitor each ½ **hour** until stable, **then** each 8 **hours**:

1. Fluid balance
1. Respiratory rate
1. Blood pressure
1. Tendon reflexes
1. Fetal heart rate

**If severe features persist**: Plan referral for delivery within 24 **hours**.

** Managing Blood Pressure **

At blood pressure between 150-160/100-110 start oral antihypertensives for example:

**Labetatol** starting dose: 100 **mg** orally every 8 **hours** (can be repeated hourly)

**OR**

**Methyldopa** starting dose: 250 **mg** orally every 8 **hours**.

Persisting blood pressure =/> 160 syst. **or** 110 diastolic must be treated **IV**

**See drug list for more details.**

Assess blood pressure every 15 minutes.

Repeat after 20 minutes until BP is below 160/110

*See drug list for more details.*

**Prevention of Eclampsia**

Give loading dose Magnesium Sulphate **4 g**r **IV** **Slowly** over 15-20 minutes (Ideally you mix it with for example **100 ml** normal saline running 3 drops per second).

**If** normal tendon reflexes **and** breathing: Give maintenance dose Magnesium Sulphate **5 g**r 50 5 solution **IM** in each buttock (You can add ½ ml. 2% lidocaine for pain relief).

*See drug list for more details.*

> **Never give MgSO4 intravenously fast, as this causes cardiac arrest!**

**Beware of toxicity!**

The first sign is loss of tendon reflexes; a more severe sign is respiratory depression with a respiratory rate < 12 per minute.

**Then you don’t give the intramuscular dose of Magnesium Sulphate. Instead you give the antidote Calcium Gluconate **1 g**r IV**
