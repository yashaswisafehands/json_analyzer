## Severe Preeclampsia


### Severe preeclampsia

See definitions.

Admit and treat.

> REMEMBER

The single most important aim is to keep systolic BP below 160 mmHg.

Insert indwelling urine catheter.

Monitor each Â½ hour until stable, then each 8 hours:

Fluid balance
Respiratory rate
Blood pressure
Tendon reflexes
Foetal heart rate

If severe features persist: Plan referral for delivery within 24 hours.



### Managing blood pressure

At blood pressure between 150-160/100-110 start **oral antihypertensives** for example:

**Labetatol **starting dose: **200 mg orally every 6-12 hours**.

OR

**Methyldopa** starting dose: **250 mg orally every 6-8 hours**.

Persisting blood pressure above 159 systolic or above 109 diastolic must be treated with IV.

See drug list for more details.

Assess the blood pressure every 15 minutes and treat with IV according to the suitable **antihypertensives** in the drug list until the blood pressure is below 160/110.

See drug list for more details.
