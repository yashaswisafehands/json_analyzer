# Hypertension Management Hypertension


## BP 140-150/90/100




If **no signs of severe preeclampsia **(see definitions):

Send home.

Schedule follow up appointment in 3-4 days, instruct in danger signs.

Plan delivery at referral facility, induction of labor at gestational age 38-39 if this procedure is performed and if gestational age is known.

## BP 150-160/100/110




Admit and observe.

Assess BP every 8 hours.

If blood pressure persists start oral antihypertensives for example:

Labetatol starting dose: 100 mg orally every 8 hours (can be repeated hourly) 
OR
Methyldopa starting dose: 250 mg orally every 8 hours.



See drug list for more details.

If blood pressure is reduced to between 140-150 systolic and 90-100 diastolic AND if there are no signs of severe preeclampsia (see definitions), the patient can be sent home.
Schedule follow up appointment in 3-4 days, instruct in danger signs.

Plan for delivery at referral facility, induction of labor at gestational age 38-39 if this procedure is performed and if gestational age is known.

## Severe Preeclampsia




See definitions.

Admit and treat.



The single most important aim is to keep systolic BP below 160 mmHg.

Insert indwelling urine catheter.

Monitor each ½ hour until stable, then each 8 hours:

Fluid balance
Respiratory rate
Blood pressure
Tendon reflexes
Foetal heart rate

If severe features persist: Plan referral for delivery within 24 hours.



### Managing blood pressure

If systolic blood pressure is between 160-180 mmHg OR diastolic 110-120 mmHg start oral antihypertensives for example:

**Labetatol starting dose: **100 mg orally every 8 hours (can be repeated hourly)

OR

**Methyldopa **starting dose: 250 mg orally every 8 hours.

If systolic blood pressure is above 180 or remains above 160 after oral treatment OR diastolic blood pressure is above 120 or remains above 110 after oral treatment: Treat with IV anti-hypertensives, for example **Hydralazine** 5 mg IV.

See drug list for more details.

Assess blood pressure every 15 minutes. Repeat after 20 minutes until BP is below 160/110.

See drug list for more details.



### Prevention of eclampsia

Give loading dose Magnesium Sulphate 4 gr IV Slowly (over 10 minutes) (You can mix it with for example 100 ml normal saline running 3 drops per second).

If normal tendon reflexes and breathing:

Give maintenance dose Magnesium Sulphate 5 gr IM in each buttock (You can add ½ ml. 2% lidocaine for pain relief).
See drug list for more details.

> Beware of toxicity!

The first sign is loss of tendon reflexes; a more severe sign is respiratory depression with a respiratory rate of 15 per minute or less.

Then you don’t give the intramuscular dose of Magnesium Sulphate.
